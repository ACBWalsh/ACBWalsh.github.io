<section class="main">

  <p>Angela Walsh (she/her) is currently a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln majoring in Emerging Media Arts with an emphasis in Cinematic Arts and Virtual Production. She is exploring her options for grad school. Basically she's a film kid with an emphasis on animation and VFX.</p>
  <p>From her start as a self-taught storyboard artist to her new love of 3D modelling, Angela had always enjoyed the creative process and telling stories. Each project comes with its own unique challenges and opportunities, something she loves to work through and find creative solutions. Problem solving doesn't just apply to STEM.</p>
  <p>When she's not working on projects, Angela like to write, listen to music, and consume media in all forms - books, YouTube, TV shows, movies, podcasts, etc.</p>
